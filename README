Summary:
This toolset is incomplete and requires more work.  Commits will be made as time goes on.  The purpose of this toolset is to
allow for a smoother development cycle of OpenCL on the fly, in C.  This gives a basic interface for the developer and making
the obscure compilation and transfer process a bit easier with AOCL.
